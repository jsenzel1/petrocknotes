Figured out and to-integrate into codebase 
(push to github after initial integration!)

stuff is going to need headers

- Leds for weekday and moon cycle

- RTC expose values (and pass these to moon calculation)

- input outputs (change pin numbers and flip polarity of outputs)

- inputs outputs assign 2nd rhythm to have its own input correctly (this will involve rewriting some constructors)

- RGBLED to epoch (using pwm)
