ask about what could be improved in video

//

- First and foremost, what's the timeline? getting gear pre launch, filming video for launch? 

- the idea of a slower post launch burn, growing from launch rather then setting up for a bang - is that realistic?

- how much do people pay for promotion 

//

- what email would you click on - wording etc. 

- what booth would you cover at a con and why 

- what elevator pitch works best

//

how the fuck are people gonna review this thing? 
it takes months to change

//

- which creators to contact - who might be specifically interested 
- getting more of a list 
currently

design thoughts? (hopefully software mostly)

//

distributors vs direct, which distributors are you more likely to buy from/think are legit?

do you think there's a difference between the 20/30/40 dollar price point or is that negligible at that point
