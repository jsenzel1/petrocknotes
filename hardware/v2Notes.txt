Panel needs to be sturdier

I/O needs to be visually clearer while thigns are plugged in for example, distinction between A and B and in and out

need light lense small holes

add switch to back for time setting mode 
(double switch? one for bootsel, one for serial acceptance?)

signal led - 2 color to show the reset out

usb C?

2 different colors for dayleds and moonleds

NOTE - polyfuse vals are wrong! 

//While working

- deleted the dnf - is that cool?

note - moon 7 and 8 swithed, days 1 and 2 switched

// LIGHT MASK 

with the new plan for some more metal on the faceplate to also help w masking,
signal leds might have so much unmasked spread that they light up phase leds - not that big of a deal though because by the time you're using signal leds, theoretically you've read the panel

however, if the RGBLED bleed is super strong on those moon phases, it might interrup some stuff (the color will light up the phase windows
but the new design should make this less likely as the jack are in between the rgbled and the indication panel stuff
