Schematic design 

//Things to drag and drop from minimal schematic
(or just take the minimal schematic and pare things down until I have something I want 

- flash 
- USB power (how much do I need this)

//Things to add 

//RTC
- finishing RTC (test connecting to i2c with adafruit breakout to pi pico)

//LEDS
- SMD LEDS
- switching configuration
- look into what rgb led needs and if going straight from gpio is viable

//POWER

- how do i deal with eurorack power source? 
- esp how do I deal with the small connector 12v and -12v 
- where do I feed the rp2040 the 5V - thinking I can just slot it into where the USB power would be? probably a place to add in power right to the chip - if its actually 12V do I need a level shifter? maybe a 12v right to 3.3v or something?

//INPUT HANDLING

- using Schotty barriers like the hagiwo stuff? maybe research this a bit more? david seemed to think that would be ok 

//OUTPUT HANDLING
