having someone else design the pcb

focusing on the stuff that I'm good at 

like programming the stuff and making the musical part 

would also really help to invest myself in the project
by paying someone directly 

and that would help me make sure I finish everything

maybe just having david or someone as a consultant

paying him for weekly meetings

and coming to him with stuff

paying 50 an hour so it feels realer
