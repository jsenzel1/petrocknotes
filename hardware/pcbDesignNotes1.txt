- Remove the dnf shit depending on how stuff works

- figure out the yellow strips on the faceplate and why they are the only ones of their color? 

- the crystsal can be the one used in rpi pico which is way tinier, which means that the flash could also go there (might be able to swing a single board if willing to through hole the battery and there's space for it)

- other space saving stuff - using opamps instead of the 8v regulator?

- smaller diode footprints for the input protection circuit
