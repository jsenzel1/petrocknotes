Hey! I'm sending this now cause we're getting closer to the deadline 

Spent some time doing a lot of picking/deleting and its now down to 132, including some new loops that are put together from other samples in the pack

still having a bit of trouble parting with some of the variations, but have definetely cut them down. I think I like variations on stuff when I use packs so I defaultly want to keep stuff, but I also like the idea of a pared down set of samples - so if there are any variation groups where you guys have a favorite from the bunch and the other could be cut that would be cool. I'm sort of at the point where I've heard stuff a bunch of times and my objectivity on what sounds different enough from one another is starting to fade a bit.
