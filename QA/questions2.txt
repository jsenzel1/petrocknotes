replacing the lm4040 with 78L08(?) 

resistor calculations for this, will this work

NO RESISTORS

which LED to use? driving LEDs direct from GPIO

/-------------------/

using RGB LEDs (old school kind) 
And how to wire them into circuit

/-------------------/

overall questions: 
organizing JLC parts pre buying?
keeping them in some sort of profile? 

//

can I trust the little one line description on the JLC description? 
how do I know exactly what I'm getting IE LED vals etc

how do I make sure that its flashable? ie that it works with usb? 
rpi pico has a button that makes it into mass storage - how does it work with real devices?

numbering components correctly in kicad
