Using small cute pointing stick/arrow for pointing to controls?

where is on screen text/bullet points gonna be? 

include metronome in recording to sync visuals

testing a few rhythms, choosing a good one (cheating)

time lapse idea? keeping it in some naturally lit place for a bit

shooting something in a cool place also with daniel 

shooting the moon on that day correctly (but then it would have to be the right phase)

shot list 

- looking at unplugged module
    - show battery spot
    - show button on back
    (thinking/talking about reset)

- whole system, pointing to indicators 

- tight shot on the module    
    - show all 4 colors of mood?

- super tight on the moon/dow stuff

- super small depth of field shots like instagram guy mattlowery

- showing me plugging stuff in to A and B, hearing individual rhythms 

- showing different clock styles, + swing etc.

- maybe setting the day/date to when the other demo was filmed, that was a good rhythm

//

- 2 going at once with the same rhythm? in the same case

- making a beat with it/extras - use microgrannie etc. (or also do this in post)
