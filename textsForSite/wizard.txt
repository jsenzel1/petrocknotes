"This ones a nasty little bugger
said the wizard, as he picked up the slimy little circuit board. it purred grogily. 
he found that it never slept, but instead moved very slowly 
with each new day a new face
with each new moon a new mood 
he stuck it into his sorceress board 
and he found too that since it was yellow
it was banana flavored

"Lick me!" cried the circuit board 
And you as well, you should totally try licking this board
its totally real
its like the switch cartridges but it actually tastes good 
like bananas
you fucking idiot i can't believe you actua
