test and implement new algos
 
do more rigorous long term simluation algo testing

finalizing clock setting protocol
do this first, implement the custom date additions, then use that to test different dates/years

POSSIBLE BUG - TIME ZONE CHANGES WHEN THE FULL MOON IS THEORIZED TO BE IE PRE OR POST MIDNIGHT ON A GIVEN DAY - LOOK INTO THIS - LOOKS LIKE MOON GIANT USES UTC WHICH IS GOOD I THINK
WONDER IF THATS ALSO WHY ALGORITHMIC WOULD SOMETIMES BE SLIGHTLY OFF

should be able to add a +/- a day for the time zone's relationship to UTC time, because we're checking every night at midnight, what phase is it, all we need to do is keep in mind that the array is made according to UTC, so that midnight time of checking will be shifted

need to implement, added timezone or UTC +/- for times

maybe need to have another 36k array of times for moon stuff that gets referenced (ew) 2d array of 2xints, 0-24 and 0-60, or one number that represents both 0-2460

taket the tm object gotten from the clock, convert it to UTC time, use that to determine the current phase from the array - is this hard? idk?

but the data array probably isn't in UTC, it's probably in EST, because that's where my computer was when I converted. Check this - if its in EST, that's fine, just convert time to est when checking phase
