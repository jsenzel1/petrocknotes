NO LIBRARIES (EEPROM, RTC, ETC)
NO ARDUINO.H

Serial.println -> printf

variables aren't byte or int, but rather uint
NOTE - CHANGE THIS SO THAT uint is int for vars that need to be negative sometimes
(might be able to just throw everything into int_16 cause memory doesn't matter when you have a fuck ton of it)
to check which vals need negatives (not that many) - search old files for "int" and then change all of those to signed, then once they're signed, uint16 could be changed to uint8 if memory is needed

completely ignore light for rn, cause it's all an external library

////TODO 

Overall-create jfunc and figure out how the header passing works on an example file 
when jfun is working in that file, it can be included in the main file and all the algo files
this is a more robust solution because also allows for more custom functions to go in later

thigns to find and replace rewrite: 
pin setup, digital read and write

XINCLUDE
Library headers for all files (includes) 

XTYPES
long and double need type conversions

XPINMODE
sort out PINMODE (and "input" etc.)

XFUNCS(RAND AND MAP)
prob easiest to write my own function to convert rand to arduino style random, same with map 

XSTRINGS
for right now just comment out any string vals - can be figured out but string vals happen to be purely for testing purposes on this project so seems like they can sort of be forgotten about for a second 

/SEED
randomseed just not working - this is very mission critical, but also a basic function so I'm sure I can get it working, maybe in a sandbox environment 

XROUNDING
implement round

#define round(x)     ((x)>=0?(long)((x)+0.5):(long)((x)-0.5))

XVAR PRINT
printf that isn't in quotes needs to be wrapped as follows (will print int formatted version)

````
printf("Value of i = %d\n",i);
```

TODO LONG TERM

/LIGHT LIB
