PLAIN ALGO 
bug in pre/post full moon 
(rhythms are always the same rhythm just shifted? probably something wrong with how the seed is being reset) 

full moon rhythm not the same rhythm

new moon also not working (for either?)

was very interesting when A or B just had 1 note populated 
maybe on the waxing/waning one, or either, or both, just has one note populated
