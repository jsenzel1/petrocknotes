Sparse
when on 16 steps - could work? prob too short

try fixed number of steps, random distribution

// sparse (this was the yellow algo i observed, remember that being the sparse one)

waxing crescent - too dense, not long enough - feels to close to plain 

super especially if you sum A and B to one rhythm - doesn't feel 'sparse'

for times where the 2 rhythm lengths *can* be different they should probably *have to be* different so its less confusing when they are and aren't the same 
this would need some external seed insertion checking stuff as well

could start/hack it by just having larger ranges so they're less likely to be equal

happened with both waxing crescent and first quarter

first/last quarter could be locked to multiples ie b is always double A, etc. 

or they're always 2:3 polyrhthm or something
