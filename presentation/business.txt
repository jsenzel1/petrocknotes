There should be something principled about the way the business end of stuff operates 

either 
- non profit
- sell at cost
- open source
- education angle 
- using copyleft liscences
- hiring locals etc. to work for me

etc. etc. or some combination 

I am in an extremely rare situation 

I don't need any revenue from this to live

So it should be some sort of statement on how I think the world should be

like the hackerspace

Eurorack design does not have to be a profit seeking endeavor 

We design because we want to see something new in the world 

For the professionals of other fields, retirees etc. 

we can design like we would tend to a garden. As much about the process as anything. As much about the change we will enact as anything. 

We have a new tool: affordable pcb assembly. And we can use it. 

note: making an educational series on how to order your own batch of circuit boards on jlc as a design
designing boards that can be ordered with zero assembly ie smd jacks, one layer of board (prob sideways panel)
