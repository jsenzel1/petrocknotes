my module is a rhythm generator with a mind of its own - you don't control it

- generates a new rhythm every night at midnight, just for that day 

- tracks the real moon phase, different phases effect the rhythm style

- overall algorithm cycles, between 4 different algorithms, every 31 days, on the new moon of a cycle

- each rhythm is a composite of A and B rhythm - seperately clockable
