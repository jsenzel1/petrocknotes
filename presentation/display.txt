LEDS

you could see all the positions of the weights etc
one for the year one for the months one for the days 

visual clock over time 

show lunar cycle moon shape 
expressive but non readable 


picture on the front that's a guide that you reference manually for lunar cycle 

showing the earth with the moon rotating around it then an inset map of the moon phase - showing time of day on the earth, and the earth going around the sun 

//

rgb LED 
red, orange, yellow, green, blue, purple, white (full) for all the stages of the moon - maybe new moon is no light 
could also do 8 (or 7 not counting new mooon?) LEDs with transluscent panel

wheel with moon cycles on it in a window (w led behind?) 

// two collums of LEDS, one for days of the week, other for moon cycles (7 and 8 respectively)
(this is in the empty space above/below the 4 inputs (2 clocks, 2 outputs)
the moon cycles and days would get underlit by leds (they would be transluscent etchings in a plastic panel 
maybe 2 different colors of LED - moon phases should def be white 

^this would imply that those 2 measurements are by far and away the 2 most important on the module
(what does that mean for design?)

rgb LEDs could note the passage of time IE the moon is white, then red, then green etc. - maybe just from white to red is cool - noting a long sequence like the passage of a calendar year or many moon cycles etc. "many moons ago" 

maye one side is moon sequence, other side is multifunctional ie theres lots of different categories and the rgb shows the position of each - or blinking? 

weekday could change color when you haven't used today's rhythm yet - maybe something blinks

colors for long term usage go roygbiv in order

// Bottom line is OLED is the best way to communicate information about time things happening over long periods - rgb LEDs good too, but more opaque (maybe that's cool/fine) - changing colors over time could be nice 

OLEd different status modes - button to switch between them and check different stats

we don't care about or even want to show lots of info/tell exactly what the module is doing - but oled allows to let the player know that there are things changing on longer timescales - a sort of omg moment of like - oh that little graphic in the corner isn't static forever, it's changing over time - gimmick addition could be the magnifying glass, connected somewhere on the board to a little anchor or zippy pull out thing

the necessary time scales to know are
things change every day 
things change every moon cycle
things change from moon cycle to moon cycle 

led strips communicate that, oled communicates that, analog stuff struggles

if I could find goddamn analog counters like on an odometer that could be awesome to have a bunch of little two digit odometers all in a row top to bottom with little symbols next to each one and they are moving slowly and out of phase with each other - would have to drive like 5 motors though - maybe just 5 pwm pins and who friekin cares

best case scenario is no screens, no LEDs, all 3 levels of information communicated


All of the analog options are pretty dope but probably don't communicate enough information ever -
