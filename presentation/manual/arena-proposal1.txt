Arena Proposal 

The channel is a practical and philosophical repository of work for a hardware synthesizer component I'm designing (currently have a working prototype) based on a new philosophy of design in which a device is treated as a collaborator rather than a tool. So, rather than being an inanimate set of manipulatable parameters, the object itself provides you with a sort of "service". It never really turns off, and it remembers how long it's lived, and changes behaviour over long periods of time like days months and years. It is not controllable, but rather provides you with something new every day (my version creates rhythms, once a day, changing behavior over longer periods).

What I would write about:

It frustrates me that devices turn off. It spoils the illusion that they're real. There's a forest behind my parent's house and a thicket of thorns. When I left for years and returned it was denser, things grew, and died, and changed. When I went to turn on my old synthesizer it performed exactly as it did when I was 14, frozen perfectly in time, switched off. I want the synthesizer to grow old like the trees do, I want it to show that it still lives when out of my line of sight - I want it to have object permanence. That way it will be real. Then I can come to it, and wake it up instead of turning it on, and ask it what it has to give me.  It will serve me what it wants. It will act differently than it did years ago. The living device allows me to see past the turning of knobs, the idea that I have ultimate control. It speaks and I listen, and it has moods, and phases, and grows old as I do. Devices need not be static, they can have lives of their own, changing with the passage of time, sitting in a drawer and thinking, and acting differently when taken out.
