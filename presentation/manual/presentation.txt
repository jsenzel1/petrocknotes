something inspired by cool datahseet drawings like this 

https://datasheet.lcsc.com/lcsc/2101071835_Q-J-CR1220-2ZX_C969906.pdf

but with some sort of grittiness/misalignment etc. like a blade runner esque schematic
maybe including the actual schematic in the presentation of the manual 


//
Making a newsprint manual 
with stamps on it and stuff 

like a little mini newspaper

middle school newspaper sized 

could print it at a school that has a school paper and pay them

module could come in a tube like pamela's, and have a rolled up little newspaper manual

should be something that you could hang on the wall like I used to do with old manuals/synth boxes

//

old school label maker labels

//

giving posters of the synth in old school car/cigarette style ish
like a black backdrop big white lettering
high res film photo with studio lighting 

for ppl to put up in synth shops and stuff 

would have to look super good to the poin that you just want to put it up in the shop
