Including a manifesto about living machines 
so you get the manual, and the manifesto
maybe as two seperate papers etc.

maybe instead of newsprint printing at a larger scale kinkos or something could be more viable 
could do it myself more

using some crazy color/style of paper 
like maybe bright yellow with black text etc.

or a DIY zine that you should cut out and assemble

using the manual like bubble wrap to protect the module

//

longer form narrative sort of 'me talking to you' stuff in the manual - like a little written work
