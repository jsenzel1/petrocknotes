you can think of it as playing the role of a sort of collaborator, offering its own prompt that you can respond to and explore

all this time-keeping is internally done on the module itself, with a clock that's always running on a reclaceable wristwatch battery that lasts years. You can always easily re sync the clock from a simple website over the USB C port, but it should stay in sync for years on its own

over the course of the moon cycle the current phase will influence the generation of the rhythm, waxing and waning along with the moon

My goal here really is not do some sort of literal translation from moon phase to rhythm, but to attach you to this object that has a slowly changing life of its own, but shares a real world anchor with you, that exists both in it's univerise, and in ours.
