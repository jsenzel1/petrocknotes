Subject: "new rhythm every 24 hours" Eurorack module at $15 retail 

Hi! I'm Jonah Senzel - finishing up a new Eurorack module and looking to talk with distributors. Everything has been built and tested, ready for scaled production - tweaking details now, planning on launching in september, but flexible. Would love to talk on phone or video for a more human being esque experience - here are the basics:

- 4hp module "Pet Rock" - generates a new rhythm every night at midnight that you have 24 hours to use (like wordle for rhythms - everyone who owns the module gets the exact same rhythm. no internet connected needed) 

- you get 2 independently clockable (gate in, gate out) 'a' and 'b' rhythms each day so there's flexibility in how you use it/clock it (can be used together as 1 composite rhythm, split into 2 separate rhythms, etc.)

- rhythm generation parameters change according to the real current moon phase, overall "mood" changes every 30 day moon cycle (keeps it fresh - changes between several custom algorithm "moods" that produce distinct styles)

- module will be open source, and sold *at cost of production* (based on prototypes, should be around $15, fully assembled) meaning I will not make any profit from it. Because of this I'm hoping to find distributors that will work with me and understand that I'm not running a normal business - I'm looking to put something interesting out into the eurorack world that anyone can afford

The module has a realtime clock that's always running, and every night at midnight it generates a new rhythm that you have exactly one day to use, until another rhythm is generated. It's kind of like wordle - a new little musical challenge each day. Every module will also produce the exact same rhythm each day as all the others, so you can compare how 2 different people used the rhythm in their track.

The module also tracks the current moon phase, and the style of each day's new rhythm is effected by where you are in the moon cycle. 

There are also several entirely different rhythm generation algorithms, which the module swaps between when you reach the end of a complete moon cycle. So just to see all the algorithms you have to use the module for a few months. These super long term modulations keep the 'one per day' concept from getting stale as you feel how the rhythms change over time.

I've done several prototype production runs and everything is pretty much ready to go - just sending some out to get feedback and do some tweaks
