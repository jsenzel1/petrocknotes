Basic architecture 

- power protection
- gate input  X2 (buffered)
- gate output X2 (buffered)  
- RTC Module Interfaced with Pi
- 1 Set selectable LED X8
- 1 Set selectable LED X7
- 1 RGB LED

some chips have pull ups on the chip itself 
check rp2040 for pull up lines

if there are pull ups in rp2040 then I can take them out (probably)

[Looks like forums are saying I should keep the pullups in there]

for first draft, I could leave in the pads and don't have them populated so if things aren't working I can put in resistors and see if it fixes things

//

you CANNOT share crystals

check the datasheet for the JLC RTC to see if it work the same way/uses the clock frequency

reccomends just using 16 resistors

never hurts to have more resistors (places to put them)

// add heirarchichal sheet
click then drag and click 

click to go in

then option delete to go back 

//

import the rtc by making new and import schematic content

digikey has good kicad libraries

// 

just get a regulator like the one on mvb that accepts 12 and regulates down to 3.3
^use this to replace existing mvb shifter 

//

check data sheet for level changing resistor (lm4040) to output 8V 

mmbt3904 transistor

research transistor buffers 

//
diystomboxes

//

I should only need one LM4040 for both outputs
(but check the data sheet for max current)
should be good for two transistor 

if there's not enough current it won't turn on the next thing in line - 7.5ma per output (15 split into 2)

check the standard current draw for a gate input on a eurorack module

//Use 2 and test with stackables to see
