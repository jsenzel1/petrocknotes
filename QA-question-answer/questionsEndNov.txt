PCB Qs

//First/immediate thoughts from David 

patch up some ground plane stuff

clean up stuff above the rp2040 thick and thin stuff 

make traces switch thicknesses less often

-12V polyfuse probably entirely useless
doesn't do anythign - doesn't hurt to have it there though

//

EURORACK RIBBON CONNECTOR 

//

1k on spreadsheet twice? 

1.01k resistor vs 1.1k etc. 

// 

is stacking done correctly? 
making sure that the eurorack connector is correctly aligned 

//

why am I getting drc 3v3 and ground connection errors? something about continuity of how stuff is connected

//

copper fills?

HE SAYS
put a little ground fill plane on the top layer to connect up the power regulators on u1 and u5 

X or alternatively just add individual vias for everything connected to u1 to ground 

IF POWER FOR SOMETHING HAS CHUNKY TRACE THE GROUND TRACE SHOULD ALSO BE THICK

are many extended parts shared between the pcbs? ill have to pay extended parts stuff twice 
prob better to just order as 2 seperate

//

Panelizing pcbs? just do 2 seperate in the order? 

//

Checklist for pre sending

- where pin one is on all the components 
- making sure orientation is right
- making sure they'll physically fit 

make sure the ground plane is totally connected

//

put capacitors on crystal for U4

front panel - making graphics into traces for lighting stuff

gold traces?
