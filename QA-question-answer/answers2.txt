double check pinouts to datasheet for regulator (and everything) 

double check mmbt3904 too

be very careful about the footprints 
make sure the footprint is correct for the polarity of the symbol (especially for diodes)

forward/drop voltage (obviously is getting used to make it brigther) 

voltage to be resisted/soaked up 
is whatevers left over after the LED gets as bright as it can with given supply

make sure the rgbled pins have PWM as an option

for red LED - try the LEDS at home maybe 

if i follow usb guidelines 
should be good for flashing 

figure out the battery clip footprint and stuff

trigger leds

add trigger LEDs to be triggered in software

x mvb power in 

david labels everything by hand

thonk footprints 
pj398sm

//

number everything
add footprints to everytyhing (associate footprints with each symbol) 

then create the pcb 
click pcb button
then update pcb from schematic


GATES GET INVERTED IN CODE 
(bc using transistor)
