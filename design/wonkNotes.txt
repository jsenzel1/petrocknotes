Rather than just tweak algo throughout moon or week
Have 2 variations on algo ie standard vs non stardard length for sparse algo

//

Listening to a good rhythm and recreating it (snare patter jd beck WHATUP) then reverse engineering an algorithm that could come up w that rhythm

//

32 steps might actually be wonkier than 64 cause its big enough to be extra wonk but not to be read as a 16th note 

Starting with 8 step xo pattern (with 3 trailing zeroes) then nudging notes around

Could just double number of steps but keep the resolution and methods
