Both length of sequence and density mapped to lunar cycle

you can progress the random values by reading the clock and startup and using values as a seed? maybe not because this will always produce the same values every monday every tuesday etc? 
not progressing the literal value but progressing the randomization range of the value 

maybe normal month dates are better because they're more tied to reality? Little screen with moon on it is also cool because it lets you know when there's actually a full moon - brings that information into your life 

real odometer 
flip clock display? (tiny) 

//Side idea - eurorack module with display that's a first person game/thing walking around - exploratory etc.
