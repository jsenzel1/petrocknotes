some modules seem to make the thousand bowls of oatmeal when tinkered with - they're not as fun as the mathy emergent models that feel more like lego bricks 

but I think that's because they take half measures - they're trying to be one thing and failing because they're also trying to do another thing which is have a signature sound/action 

my module has no doubts about the fact that you are given a challenge, and you use it 

hopefully that sets it apart as a sort of new kind of module
