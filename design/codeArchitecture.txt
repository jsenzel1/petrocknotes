Making a generator class

class takes global inputs like slop, max rand length etc., and also what algorithm to use

then in the class algorithms are their own methods (or a switch in a big method) 

but in that method, when it comes time to actually play a note - you call the outputNote() method, and that method contains all the code for doing slop, etc.

for lunar length modulation use nonlinear curves on input
