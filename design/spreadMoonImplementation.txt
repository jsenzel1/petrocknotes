each moon phase has a base length that's sequential/simple ie 

7
8
9
10
12
13
14
15


or there are authored pairings for each phase 

7/11
8/15
12/13 same rhythm w/1 rest

16/16 same rhythm

9/10  same rhythm w/1 rest
5/10
6/18


maybe reich should always have same length 
bc payoff is still longer 
same exact rhythm on full
cycle determines set length
