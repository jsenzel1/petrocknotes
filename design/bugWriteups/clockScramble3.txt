try doing the clock read/write test with the actual example code 

remember, why does it generally work when usb plugged in? usb isn't magic

//

note in the usb example 

if(TARGET tinusb_device)

investigate that line

also disable uart maybe

also order of cmakelists?

NOTE from august 7th 

getting this bug again when using eurorack power, didn't i solve it? 

note - when I include usbwait, and plug it into eurorack power, it doesn't scramble anything, implying that if it doesn't reach the mcu, nothing is scrambled (this is good - implies its not a hard path circuitry issue)

but after the rack scrambles it, it still reads scrambled on USB 

as in some cases before, it seems like the *act of reading the clock* scrambles it (but only on eurorack power) not sure if I ended up just ignoring this since it only happened with (one?) module previously now I've seen at least 2 w this bug, scary

//

update:

when it happens only on eurorack power, but usb is fine - that appears to mean there's a problem with the battery

I succesfully replicated the bad behavior using a known(?) bad battery, then used a good one and had no problems - implies that's the issue
