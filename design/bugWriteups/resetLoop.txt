LEAD:
Seems like this reset loop issue, or also the issue of crashing at initialization etc. 
is caused by issues with initializing both instances of a given algo one right after the other/at the same time 
when I just use one, everything runs smoothly 
maybe look into a delay or check unique identifier bug possibilities etc.

or I wonder if this just means that having 2 is taking up max memory immediately when they're initialized 

In this case reset loop being trigger by algoOver class declaration (not init, not loop[seemingly]) 
previously this problem was solved with some syntax error 

reset loop means arduino is crashing and rebooting 
could be a memory overflow 
or some syntax crashing somethign 

this seemingly fixed by just commenting out some line of mysteriously breaking code and rewriting it with new var name??? super weird - also seems like it just made it break in a different way later
