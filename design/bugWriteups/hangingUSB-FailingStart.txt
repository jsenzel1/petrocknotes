Using PCB 1 

sometimes the upload just doesn't work 
usb hangs, km doesnt work, etc, etc

this is using AlgoPlain

BUT

if I kill it with km, 
run a dummy script (right now in AlgoReich) 
the dummy script works with the blinking LED 

and then when I upload the original script version
using the AlgoPlain code
it works perfectly, LED blinks 
WTF gives 

odd bug 

thinking it could have something to do with memory etc.
