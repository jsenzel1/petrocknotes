
Maybe just adding a sleep function in between some stuff like initialization stuff and clock reading etc

Could cuc usb be taking place of some other serial ready function/var? 

Maybe check the pcf8523 example more for serial stuff

Although didnt have issues for weeks so probably issue is something i added rather than not having boilerplate 

And check on 2 modules at once

Mk probably worked because there was some sort of extra usb preparation

Could be race conditions that are now different because i added more code ie calculating the moon cycle with a different algo or something

Still doesnt explain the sandbox problem

There needs to be a replacement line for cuc usb connected that waits for internal serial stuff or something 

Maybe need to not stdio init all

Esp cause in the sandbox problem
