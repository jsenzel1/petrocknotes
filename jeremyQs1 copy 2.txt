show video

ask about what could be improved in video

//

- First and foremost, what's the timeline? getting gear pre launch, filming video for launch? 

- the idea of a slower post launch burn, growing from launch rather then setting up for a bang - is that realistic?

- how much do people pay for promotion 

[making a little outline really helps
making a bullet point list of things im trying to say] 

[wordle thing good, people will like it will hit hard]

[the idea of it being a prompt is powerful - keep that in there - good way of thinking about it]

[rare in eurorack where there's no control - completely different mentality] 

[at 0:45 - so far doing great, but he cuts as many ums and ahs as possible - crisp and clean with no filler words]

[as the person who made this I can flash it with any parameter that I want - I can show it on a different day, different mood, different moon] 

[there's gonna be a real challenge showing it off because people can't see different rhythms - I have to show off the variety etc. - maybe with some pre set dates - they can't do that I can] 

[bring up the software update and clock set thing - how is it not going to get desynced?? show that in video] 

[maybe bring up how many colors there are immediately]

[wants some euclidean phasing generator] 

[keep it a mystery to some extent] 

[look at whimsical wraps manuals - they keep it mysterious] 

[mention the manual thing of keeping you on pace with natural phenomenon, not a direct moon translation]

- what email would you click on - wording etc. 

- what booth would you cover at a con and why 

- what elevator pitch works best

//

how the fuck are people gonna review this thing? 
it takes months to change

//

- which creators to contact - who might be specifically interested 
- getting more of a list

design thoughts? (hopefully software mostly)

//

distributors vs direct, which distributors are you more likely to buy from/think are legit?

do you think there's a difference between the 20/30/40 dollar price point or is that negligible at that point
